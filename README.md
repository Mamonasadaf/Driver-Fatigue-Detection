# Driver-Fatigue-Detection
This Repo reviews deep learning and computer vision methods for driver fatigue detection using facial analysis. It evaluates CNN, EAR, MAR, and hybrid models, focusing on real-time deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Results will show optimized models enable efficient, real-time fatigue monitoring on edge devices.
